Thus, we are interested in learning more about the type of students that enroll in courses like STAT107.  From Fall 2019-Fall 2022, 1059 students enrolled in STAT107.  Rather than track down and ask each of these 1059 students questions, we will use the students in *this lab section* (who have presumably taken STAT107) in an attempt to learn more about the larger population of **all students who have taken STAT107 in the last seven semesters.**\n",
